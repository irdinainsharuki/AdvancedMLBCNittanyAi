# Advanced Machine Learning Bootcamp (MLB) - Nittany AI @ Penn State
As part of the Nittany AI Machine Learning Bootcamp at Penn State, Iâ€™m engaging in an immersive learning experience structured into four key areas of AI over the course of the semester:

**Data Cleaning & Classification (Titanic Dataset):** Preprocessed a corrupted dataset (handling missing values, duplicates, and type inconsistencies) and trained a classification model to predict survival outcomes.

**CNN for Medical Imaging (Chest X-rays):** Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on pneumonia X-ray datasets, achieving >65% classification accuracy using deep learning frameworks.

**RAG-based Chatbot (Stock Market Textbook):** Developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot leveraging vector databases to answer domain-specific questions directly from a reference textbook.

**Reinforcement Learning (CartPole):** Implemented a reinforcement learning agent to balance a cartpole system, gaining hands-on experience with RL algorithms and their applications.
